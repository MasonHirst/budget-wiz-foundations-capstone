# Welcome to my Budget Wiz project! If you want to run this project on your machine, you need to follow a few steps:

# To get going, navigate in terminal to the root folder of this project, and run 'npm i'

# Create a file called '.env' in the root of the project

# In your .env file, create a variable called 'PORT', and set it equal to a number between 3000 and 6000 (example: PORT=3550).
  
# Also in your .env file, create a variable called 'DATABASE_URL' and set it equal to your own database URL string (You will have to set up a database for this project).
  
# In terminal, run the command 'nodemon'. If that does not work, then navigate to the 'server' folder, then run 'nodemon server.js'.
  
# You can now open chrome and visit 'localhost:3550', and you will see the website! If you used a different PORT number, put that number instead of 3550.
