I want to build a custom budgeting website for my wife and I to use with our monthly budget meetings.

The app will have an account based system, so that we can login and see our own budgets and transactions. 
After you have created an account and logged in, the app will take you to another html page, the home page.
The home page will have quick views of your total budgets, spending, income vs outgo, etc. It will also 
have quick forms to submit an expense, create a new budget, and change existing budgets.


MVP: Login feature, create budget feature (set budget categories and amounts), add expense feature (select 
a category and submit amount spent), and edit existing budget category limits.



Features I want to add if I have time:
    - I want to hash passwords when they are inputted so that passwords are never stored in the system.
    - I want to have a selenium chromedriver test that tests my front end for me when I make changes
    - I want to have a session so a user stays logged in after refreshes
    - maybe an email checker to see if the inputted email actually exists. This would make testing harder though
    - add an automatic timestamp to incomes and expenses
